### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorites because it was my fist lab ever, I also did't know what to do so I ended up with a 0 in that assignment:(. But I think it was an important step, because without this lab I wouldnâ€™t do self study about c++.
* Lab 7

    Lab 7- Part-2 is my favorite lab because I love gambling on poker and blackjack, so being able to program a game of blackjack was really fun and interesting. It was also the first time using functions in class wich I had my doubts on how to use it, but after this assignment everything was good,  

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was really important to me because it was on this lab that I learned most of the essential codes like how to git clone, push, add, status, commit and how to format. This was the start of everything since I was lost in the first day.
